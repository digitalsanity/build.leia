# build.leia

This is a complete hack to fetch(clone), update, compile and install [Kodi](xbmc/xbmc) from source.

It uses the Z Shell (ZSH) as I find it more than capable for my needs.

The script also uses **sudo** to install Kodi and the binary-addons. Please make sure you are in the **sudoers** list.

Default installation dir is **/opt/Leia**. This can be changed by editing the PREFIX variable in **build.leia**.
